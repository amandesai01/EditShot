## Description

Suppose you want to edit a MarkSheet before taking a screenshot, or just want a tool to make a prank, or you want to make a meme. All these requires taking a screenshot and then editing it. If someone is tech savy, he/she may use inspect element. Well, this tool makes this process easier.

Here's how:
* Once you hit "Make Screen Editable", it grabs all the elements in the DOM and sets their `contenteditable` property yo `true`. 
* Then, it iterates over all the links and deletes their `href` propery. Thus, saving user from getting redirected while editing. :wink:
* Lastly, when user hits the `Take Screenshot` button, it uses `html2canvas` library to generate a image. It is in memory currently.
* Then, it creates an "in-memory" `a` tag, appends the data to the URL by doing some conversions and hits that a tag.
* Ofcourse everything is done behind the scenes and quickly. So this dosen't hamper the experience. :smile:


```
This extension is UNDER REVIEW and once done,
it will be available for download from chrome webstore. Link will be updated instead of this box once verification is done.
